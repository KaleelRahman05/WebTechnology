 scientist best known as the inventor of the World Wide Web, HTML, the URL system,
 and HTTP. He is a professorial research fellow at the University of Oxford[2] and a professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). Berners-Lee
 proposed an information management system on 12 March 1989 and implemented the first successful communication between a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) client and server via the Internet in mid-November. He devised and implemented the first Web
 browser and Web server and helped foster the Web's subsequent development. He is the founder
 and emeritus director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), which oversees the continued development of the Web. He co-founded (with Rosemary Leith) the World Wide Web Foundation. In April 2009, he was elected as Foreign Associate of the National Academy of Sciences

<p style="font-size:16px;line-height:30px">Berners-Lee was born in London on 8 June 1955, the son of mathematicians and computer
 scientists Mary Lee Berners-Lee (née Woods; 1924–2017) and Conway Berners-Lee (1921–2019). His parents were both from 
 Birmingham and worked on the Ferranti Mark 1,
 the first commercially-built computer. He has three younger siblings; his brother, Mike, is a professor of 
 ecology and climate change management. Berners-Lee attended Sheen Mount Primary School, then attended Emanuel 
 School (a direct grant grammar school 
at the time) from 1969 to 1973. A keen trainspotter as a child, he learnt about electronics from 
tinkering with a model railway.From 1973 to 1976, he studied at The Queen's College, Oxford, where he received a first-class 
BA in physics. While there, he made a computer out of an old television set he had purchased from a repair shop.</p>

telecommunications company Plessey in Poole, Dorset. In 1978, he joined D. G. Nash in Ferndown, Dorset, where he helped create 
typesetting software for printers. Berners-Lee worked as an independent contractor at CERN from June to December 1980.
 While in Geneva, he proposed a
 project based on the concept of hypertext, to facilitate sharing and updating information among researchers. 
 To demonstrate it, he built a prototype system named ENQUIRE. After leaving CERN in late
 1980, he went to work at John Poole's Image Computer Systems, Ltd, in Bournemouth, Dorset. He ran the company's 
 technical side for three years. The project he worked on was a "real-time remote procedure call" which gave him experience 
 in computer networking. In 1984, he returned to CERN as a fellow.</p>
